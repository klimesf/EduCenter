Mottos:

    - Add comments wherever needed
    - When tired, work on the looks (CSS)
    - Focus on reusability of your code




Tasks:
20-9-2013
    + Remake all the MVC classes, start over, focus on keeping code simple and clean
    - Add comments wherever needed
    - Possibly make a chart of the application logic
    + Think through the app logic - especially evaluating the test

    + Create component QuestionDisplay
    - Create component UnitList

27-9-2013
    + Implement QuestionDisplay->checkedAnswers->areCorrect()
    - Instead of handing $questionId to QuestionDisplay, handle the whole selection,
	that would help browsing by unit and also would be nice to have prepared
	such feature for implementing testing module
