    - Focus on reusability of your code

    + Remake all the MVC classes, start over, focus on keeping code simple and clean

    - Create component UnitList

27-9-2013
    + Implement QuestionDisplay->checkedAnswers->areCorrect()
    - Instead of handing $questionId to QuestionDisplay, handle the whole selection,
	that would help browsing by unit and also would be nice to have prepared
	such feature for implementing testing module
